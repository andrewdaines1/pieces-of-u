# Remote Configuration

This repository is configured with the following Git remote:

- **origin**: https://github.com/andrewdaines1/pieces-of-u

The local `main` branch is set to track `origin/main`. Network access to the remote may be restricted in this environment, so `git fetch` and `git pull` can fail even though the tracking configuration is in place.
